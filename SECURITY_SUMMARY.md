- **minimatch** package vulnerabilities (ReDoS)
- **on-headers** package vulnerabilities
- **path-to-regexp** package vulnerabilities (ReDoS)

### Actions Taken:
1. Replaced vulnerable `serve` package with secure `http-server`
2. Updated package.json scripts to use `http-server`
3. Verified functionality with new static server
4. Confirmed 0 vulnerabilities with `npm audit`

## 🛡️ Phase 2: Input Validation and SQL Injection Prevention

### Security Enhancements:
1. **Created comprehensive input validation library** (`lib/inputValidation.ts`):
   - Project name validation (length, dangerous characters)
   - Project description validation with HTML sanitization
   - PIN format validation with numeric-only enforcement
   - ULID format validation for IDs
   - Numeric input validation with special value rejection
   - JSON data validation with size limits
   - Rate limiting for authentication attempts

2. **Enhanced DAO layer** (`db/dao.ts`):
   - Added input validation to all create functions
   - Sanitized all user inputs before database operations
   - Maintained parameterized queries (already secure)

3. **Updated UI components**:
   - Enhanced NewProjectModal with client-side validation
   - Added proper form validation and error handling

### SQL Injection Protection:
- ✅ All queries already used parameterized statements
- ✅ Added input validation as additional layer
- ✅ No string concatenation in SQL queries found

## 🔒 Phase 3: Electron Security Hardening

### Security Improvements:
1. **Created security utilities library** (`lib/security.ts`):
   - Content Security Policy configuration
   - URL validation for navigation control
   - File path validation to prevent directory traversal
   - Secure token generation
   - Security event logging

2. **Enhanced Electron main process** (`electron/main.ts`):
   - Improved network request blocking with security logging
   - Enhanced app protocol with path validation
   - Added security headers to all responses
   - Strengthened navigation controls

3. **Hardened preload script** (`electron/preload.ts`):
   - Added filename validation for SQLite access
   - Restricted allowed file access

4. **Added middleware** (`middleware.ts`):
   - Implemented security headers for all routes
   - Added path traversal protection
   - Configured CSP headers

### Content Security Policy:
- `default-src 'self'` - Only allow same-origin resources
- `object-src 'none'` - Block object/embed tags
- `frame-ancestors 'none'` - Prevent clickjacking
- Additional directives for comprehensive protection

## 🔐 Phase 4: Authentication and Authorization Security

### Authentication Enhancements:
1. **Enhanced AuthService** (`core/auth/AuthService.ts`):
   - Added rate limiting for PIN attempts
   - Implemented session expiration (30 minutes)
   - Added security event logging
   - Enhanced input validation for all auth operations

2. **Session Management**:
   - Automatic session expiration
   - Session cleanup for expired sessions
   - Secure session token generation
   - Maximum sessions per account limit

3. **PIN Security**:
   - Strengthened PIN validation
   - Rate limiting to prevent brute force
   - Enhanced error messages without information leakage

### Vault Security:
- Added input validation for all vault operations
- Enhanced error handling with security logging
- Maintained strong encryption (already secure)

## 🧪 Phase 5: Security Testing and Validation

### Test Coverage:
1. **Input Validation Tests** (39 tests):
   - SQL injection prevention
   - XSS protection
   - Input sanitization
   - Rate limiting functionality

2. **Security Unit Tests** (23 tests):
   - File path security
   - URL validation
   - Filename validation
   - Cryptographic security

3. **Security Integration Tests** (19 tests):
   - End-to-end security validation
   - Authentication security
   - Vault security
   - Data sanitization

### Vulnerability Scanning:
- ✅ `npm audit`: **0 vulnerabilities**
- ✅ All security tests passing
- ✅ Application builds successfully
- ✅ Functionality preserved
